# Detection-of-Epilepsy-using-CNN
The problem of epilepsy has grown exponentially and is now considered as one of the most  prevailing neurological disorders affecting around 50 million people around the globe. Epilepsy is  identified by analyzing the interictal activity present in the EEG signal. Visual analysis of EEG is  a tedious process and subject to human error. This work proposes a robust method to ease the  burden of intractable seizures by automatic recognition of ictal epileptiform activity in the EEG of  epileptic patients. The classification between EEG having an epileptic seizure and non-seizure is  done using various machine learning algorithms. The classifiers used are weighted KNN, Boosted  Trees, Bagged Trees, subspace discrimination, Subspace KNN and RUS boosted tree. Based on  the accuracy of the classifier we will select one method and we will export the model as function  to use for validation purpose. These are the methods used to classify epileptic seizure EEG signals.
